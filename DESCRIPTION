Description: The goal of cranalysis is to provide a few handy functions to
    analyse CRAN's PACKAGES file. Initially this is focused on providing a
    list of package dependencies for a given list of packages. This was
    hastily thrown together and needs quite a lot more work to make it
    robust and introduce some tests etc.
